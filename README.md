# P33 Project - HawkFinance

--> Final Project for CS-100

Project to research and develop a budget management dashboard to manage personal finances.
Balancing finances and college courses can be difficult for students (such as freshman, seniors etc.,). 
To combat this issue, research about the problem and find a solution that makes it easier to manage finances
so students can focus on their career.

Users can enter in expenses, categorize them, and see visualizations of where their money has
been spent and generate reports. Display upcoming bills and ability to access bank accounts so they can
pay the bills automatically using integration features. Users should be able to enter their salary info and
manage their budget. Essentially, itâ€™s a tool for budget management on personal finances in a dashboard.
This dashboard can be accessible through either web portal or desktop application, and it should be easy
to navigate for everyone.

The team worked with professional software engineers at JPMorgan Chase to help design solutions to the problem.
Weekly deliverables needed to be met from the start to the end of a software engineering project using Agile
and Scrum Methodologies
